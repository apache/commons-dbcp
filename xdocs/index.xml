<section name="The DBCP Component">

<p>Many Jakarta projects support interaction with a relational database.
Creating a new connection for each user can be time consuming (often
requiring multiple seconds of clock time), in order to perform a database
transaction that might take milliseconds.  Opening a connection per user
can be unfeasible in a publicly-hosted Internet application where the
number of simultaneous users can be very large.  Accordingly, developers
often wish to share a "pool" of open connections between all of the
application's current users.  The number of users actually performing
a request at any given time is usually a very small percentage of the
total number of active users, and during request processing is the only
time that a database connection is required.  The application itself logs
into the DBMS, and handles any user account issues internally.</p>

<p>There are several Database Connection Pools already available, both
within Jakarta products and elsewhere.  This Commons package provides an
opportunity to coordinate the efforts required to create and maintain an
efficient, feature-rich package under the ASF license.</p>

<p>The <code>commons-dbcp</code> package relies on code in the
<code>commons-pool</code> package to provide the underlying object pool
mechanisms that it utilizes.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/dbcp/api/index.html">
JavaDoc API documents</a> are available online.  In particular, you should
read the package overview of the <code>org.apache.commons.dbcp</code>
package.</p>

<p>There are 
<a href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/jakarta-commons/dbcp/doc/">several examples</a> 
of using DBCP available.</p>
