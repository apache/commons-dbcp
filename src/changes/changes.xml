This file is used by the maven-changes-plugin to generate the release notes.
Useful ways of finding items to add to this file are:

1.  Add items when you fix a bug or add a feature (this makes the 
release process easy :-).

2.  Do a bugzilla search for tickets closed since the previous release.

3.  Use the report generated by the maven-changelog-plugin to see all
SVN commits.  Set the project.properties' maven.changelog.range 
property to the number of days since the last release.

To generate the release notes from this file:

mvn changes:announcement-generate -Prelease-notes [-Dchanges.version=nnn]

then tweak the formatting if necessary
and commit

The <action> type attribute can be add,update,fix,remove.

    <!-- NOTE:
    The description below is specially formatted so as to improve the layout of the generated release notes:
    The parsing process removes all line feeds, replacing them with a single space.
    The Velocity template in src/changes has been enhanced to replace pairs of adjacent spaces
    with a new-line in the release notes. (These spaces are ignored when displaying HTML).
    If the output is not quite correct, check for invisible trailing spaces!

    N.B. The release notes template groups actions by type, and only extracts data for the current release.
    The changes report outputs actions in the order they appear in this file.

    To regenerate the release notes:
    mvn changes:announcement-generate -Prelease-notes [-Dchanges.version=nnn]

    Defining changes.version allows one to create the RN without first removing the SNAPSHOT suffix.

    <release version="2.0" date="3 March 2014" description=
"This release includes new features as well as bug fixes and enhancements.
 Version 2.0.x supports JDBC 4.1, so requires Java 7.
 
 The Java package name has been changed from 'org.apache.commons.dbcp' to 'org.apache.commons.dbcp2'.
 Also the Maven groupId is now 'org.apache.commons' and the artifactId is 'commons-dbcp2'
 These changes are necessary because the API is not strictly binary compatible with the 1.x releases.
 To convert from the earlier releases, update the package name in imports, update the dependencies and recompile.
 There may be a few other changes to be made.

 Applications running under Java 7 should use DBCP 2.0.x.
 Java 6 users should use DBCP 1.4.x which supports JDBC 4.
 Java 1.4 and Java 5 users should use DBCP 1.3.x which supports JDBC 3.
