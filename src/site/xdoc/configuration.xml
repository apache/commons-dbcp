<strong>NOTE</strong>: If maxIdle is set too low on heavily loaded systems it is
possible you will see connections being closed and almost immediately new
connections being opened. This is a result of the active threads momentarily
closing connections faster than they are opening them, causing the number of
idle connections to rise above maxIdle. The best value for maxIdle for heavily
loaded system will vary but the default is a good starting point.

This component has also the ability to pool PreparedStatements.
When enabled a statement pool will be created for each Connection
and PreparedStatements created by one of the following methods will be pooled:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>public PreparedStatement prepareStatement(String sql)</li>
   <li>public PreparedStatement prepareStatement(String sql, int resultSetType, int resultSetConcurrency)</li>
</ul>
<p>
<img src="images/icon_warning_sml.gif" alt="Warning"/>
<strong>NOTE</strong> - Make sure your connection has some resources left for the other statements.
Pooling PreparedStatements may keep their cursors open in the database, causing a connection to run out of cursors,
especially if maxOpenPreparedStatements is left at the default (unlimited) and an application opens a large number
of different PreparedStatements per connection. To avoid this problem, maxOpenPreparedStatements should be set to a
value less than the maximum number of cursors that can be open on a Connection.

<p>When allowed you can access the underlying connection using the following construct:</p>

Default is false, it is a potential dangerous operation and misbehaving programs can do harmful things. (closing the underlying or continue using it when the guarded connection is already closed)
Be careful and only use when you need direct access to driver specific extensions.

      A connection is considered abandoned and eligible
      for removal if it has not been used for longer than removeAbandonedTimeout.<br/>
      Creating a Statement, PreparedStatement or CallableStatement or using
      one of these to execute a query (using one of the execute methods)

      trace has to be generated.  
   </td>

   <td>abandonedUsageTracking</td>
   <td>false</td>
   <td>
      If true, the connection pool records a stack trace every time a method is called on a

      of abandoned connections. There is significant overhead added by setting this
      to true.

<p>
<img src="images/icon_info_sml.gif" alt="Info"/>
If you have enabled removeAbandonedOnMaintenance or removeAbandonedOnBorrow then it is possible that
a connection is reclaimed by the pool because it is considered to be abandoned. This mechanism is triggered
when (getNumIdle() &lt; 2) and (getNumActive() &gt; getMaxTotal() - 3) and removeAbandonedOnBorrow is true;
or after eviction finishes and removeAbandonedOnMaintenance is true. For example, maxTotal=20 and 18 active
connections and 1 idle connection would trigger removeAbandonedOnBorrow, but only the active connections
that aren't used for more then "removeAbandonedTimeout" seconds are removed (default 300 sec). Traversing
a resultset doesn't count as being used. Creating a Statement, PreparedStatement or CallableStatement or
using one of these to execute a query (using one of the execute methods) resets the lastUsed property of
the parent connection.
